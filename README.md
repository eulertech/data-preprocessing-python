##features

Not having the correct and complete data is often the most cited reason for analytics projects failures, regardless of Big or Small data. To mitigate the problem, data-driven companies are giving importance to preparing and curating the data, and make it ready for analysis. It is a well-established fact that typically 60-70% of time in any analytics project is spent on data capture and preparation, and hence robust data management tools are important to drive efficiency and time savings. In a Predictive Modeling environment, data preparation is closely associated with the Pre-modeling phase.
